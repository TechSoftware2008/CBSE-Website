<h1><i><u>BIODIVERSITY</u><BR>Biodiversity is the biological variety and variability of life on Earth. Biodiversity is
a measure of variation at the genetic, species, and ecosystem level. Terrestrial 
biodiversity is usually greater near the equator, which is the result of the warm 
climate and high primary productivity. Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth, 
and is richer in the tropics.These tropical forest ecosystems cover less than 10% of 
earth's surface and contain about 90% of the world's species.Marine biodiversity is
usually higher along coasts in the Western Pacific, where sea surface temperature
is highest, and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans. There are latitudinal 
gradients in species diversity. Biodiversity generally tends to cluster in hotspots, 
and has been increasing through time.but will be likely to slow in the future as a 
primary result of deforestation. It encompasses the evolutionary, ecological, and 
cultural processes that sustain life.Rapid environmental changes typically cause
mass extinctions. More than 99.9% of all species that ever lived on Earth,amounting 
to over five billion species, are estimated to be extinct.Estimates on thenumber of 
Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million, of which about 1.2 
million have been documented and over 86% have not yet been described. The total 
amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037 and weighs 50 
billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated
 to be as much as four trillion tons of carbon. In July 2016, scientists reported 
identifying a set of 355 genes from the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) of 
all organisms living on Earth.<BR>
		     There are three types of Biodiversity:<BR>
1.<u>GENETIC</u><BR>		2.<u>SPECIES</u><BR>	                 3.<u>  ECOSYSTEM DIVERSITY</u><BR>
<u>Genetic</u>:refers to the range of different inherited traits within a species. In a species 
with high genetic diversity, there would be many individuals with a wide variety of 
different traits. Genetic diversity is critical for a population to adapt to changing 
environments.<br>
<u>Species</u>:  is simply the number and relative abundance of species found in a given 
biological organisation (population, ecosystem, Earth). Species are the basic units of
biological classification and hence, this is the measure most commonly associated 
with the term 'biodiversity'.<br>
<u>Ecosystem diversity</u> : can be defined as the variety of different habitats, communities
and ecological processes. A biological community is defined by the species that 
occupy a particular area and the interactions between those species.<br>
